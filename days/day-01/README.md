# Day 01 â€” Hello CLI

**Goal:** Print a friendly message and show simple argument parsing.  
**Stack:** Python 3.10+ (`argparse`, `pathlib`)

## How to run
```bash
python main.py --name "Benjamin"
```

## What I learned
- Basic CLI arguments with `argparse`
- Using f-strings
- Keeping code in a `main()` guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`

## Notes
- Replace this file with your real notes next time. The `templates/DAY_README_TEMPLATE.md` is there to copy for new days.
