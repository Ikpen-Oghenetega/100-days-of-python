2. Upload everything inside this folder to that repo (drag & drop in the web UI).
3. Each day, copy `templates/DAY_README_TEMPLATE.md` into a new folder `days/day-XX/`.
4. Put your code for that day in the same folder, update the README, commit.
5. To share on X/Twitter: open the code file on GitHub → press **Y** to copy a permanent link → paste it in your tweet.
